# smol-rs

Currently building a game with this framework to actually see what features would be useful to have instead of randomly adding features as I go.

This project isn't really for anyone else to use besides myself but I figured I would keep the source open so anyone can see how I've implemented things.


### Current features
* Font rendering
* Sprite rendering
* Rect rendering
* Asesprite texture packing


### Work in progress

* Renders using OpenGL
* SDL2 for platform layer
* Render batching


### CURRENT GOALS

 * Easy to use API
 * Runs on most platforms but Windows is the main target
 * Mostly 2D
 
 

### LONG TERM GOALS
* DirectX support
* Vulkan support
* Build a game with it
* Run on the switch
